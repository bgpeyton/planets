Topics for discussion:
    Quantum mechanics (?)
        How much detail is necessary? Dependent on the length of my other topics?
        TD DFT
    Chiroptical properties (response properties in general?)
    Many body expansion
    Basis Set Superposition Error
        Basis Set Imbalance Error
        Basis Set Extension Effect
            Competing viewpoints (Full cluster vs hierarchy scheme [Site-site Function Counterpoise (SSFC) vs Valiron-Mayer Function Counterpoise (VMFC)])
            Mention current/future work to determine the importance of these in final section (Future work / objectives)     

Questions:
    Within each topic, should I reserve discussion of results of past work / plans for future work for the final section? 
    Timeframe? How often can I submit work for you to review? Can I / should I have group members look at short pieces (equations, sentences, etc)?

OUTLINE:
1. Introduction
    - Overview: introduce the problem and the approach to solving it
    - Calculation of response properties -> accurate quantum chemical methods -> reduced-scaling
      -> many body theory -> basis set superposition error
    - This is one of many "angles of attack" for the problem of accurate response properties
    - Other options include reduced-scaling CC, special/truncated basis sets, molecular dynamics, etc 
    - (Check Big Picture on Sirius wiki)
    - "If one is forced to compute properties of snapshots of explicit solute-solvent systems along an 
       MD trajectory, then a critical question is the number of solvent molecules that one must include 
       for a realistic simulation."
        - MBE reduces the cost of these calculations, and BSSE corrections can (should) improve their accuracy
2. Theory
    A. Response Properties
        - Introduce the importance and difficulty of the problem (justify expensive methods in section B)
        - Specific attention to chiroptical properties
        - Too little known about this subject at the present time. READ!
    B. Accurate Quantum Chemical Methods
        - Basically introduce and justify my choice in theory despite its cost
        - Hartree Fock -> TD-DFT 
        - ------------ -> Full CI -> Coupled Cluster -> EOM-CC (?) + CC-LR (?)
            - EOM-CC and CC-LR are not /too/ important, can summarize the important aspects in maybe a page
?       - Maybe a sub-section for each level of theory? 
    C. Reducing Scaling for Quantum Chemical Methods 
        a. Adjust the theory: reduced scaling for coupled cluster, TDDFT, etc
?       b. Adjust the basis: optimized/truncated basis sets for response properties, FVNO's, etc
?       c. Adjust the model: many-body expansion (maybe talk about QM/MM and implicit solvent methods?)
    D. Many-body Expansion
        - Introduce the equations, mention previous convergence issues for properties
        - Possible culprit: BSSE
    E. Basis Set Superposition Error
        a. Counterpoise (CP) Method (Boys-Bernardi 1970)
            - Generalized to site-site function counterpoise (SSFC) method (Wells-Wilson 1983)
            - Generally the starting point to other BSSE schemes, uses the full basis
        b. Valiron-Mayer Function Counterpoise (VMFC) Method (Valiron-Mayer 1997)
            - Truncated VMFC(n) approaches introduced later (find citation)
            - Gets rid of Basis Set Imbalance Error (BSIE) and Basis Set Extention Effect (BSEE)
            - Not trying to approximate SSFC method, believes BSEE to be a problem, hierarchical scheme
        c. Many-Ghost Many-Body Expansion (MGMBE) (Ouyang-Bettens 2015)
            - Generalization of Many-Body Counterpoise (MBCP) (Richard-Herbert 2013)
            - Gets rid of BSIE but keeps BSEE (under the assumption that BSEE is not actally a problem)
            - Attempting to approximate SFCC
        d. Ongoing debate: is BSEE good or bad?
            - Mayer 2017 paper, Liu-Herbert in-review paper (if published)
                - Need to finish reading these for the most current "verdict"
3. State of the Union / Goals
    A. Past work: Mach-Crawford 2014
    B. Current work: test different BSSE corrections for MBE (show results if available)
    C. Future work: couple BSSE-corrected MBE to other "big picture" options to match experiment
